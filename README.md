# Bangla-AR-Book
Bangla ARbook is a cross-platform app that is developed using Unity3d. It is an Augmented Reality app for pre-primary 
school student to teach them Bengali alphabet using augmented 3d model. It uses the pre -primary board book for 
augmentation. This app was developed as a part of a conference paper (submitted for review, not published yet).

### Features:
* Augmented 3d model for each picture in the book.
* Image targets are integrated in the app. I also tried using Cloud image target.
* All the model are in a web server, they are downloaded based on the image target from the server.
* Testing feature to test if they learned well or not.

### Technology/Library used:
* Unity3d
* Vuforia Augmented Reality library
* 3d Assetbundle from webserver.
